# Running and writing tests

The Bot Playtesting Toolkit comes with a number of tests that can be run to assure that functionality has not been broken.

The tests can be run by running the `runTests()` function, available in the file with tests.

(This should be complemented by instructions on how to write new tests, and how to interpret test results.)
