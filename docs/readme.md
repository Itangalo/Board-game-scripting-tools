# Documentation for the Bot Playtesting Toolkit

Check out the [introduction](01-introduction.md) if you haven't met the Bot Playtesting Toolkit before. The [using the Bot Playtesting Toolkit](02-using-the-toolkit.md) page gives an introduction on a more technical level.

The other files document the functions and classes that the toolkit provides (still to be ported from the project wiki).

The technical documentation is kept here on GitHub, but you can find thoughts about how to use the Bot Playtesting Toolkit on [Johan Falk's blog about creating board games](https://creatingboardgames.wordpress.com/category/bot-playtesting-toolkit/).
