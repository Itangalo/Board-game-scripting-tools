 * @param {object} marketData: An object with properties to transfer to
 * the market object. Some special properties:
 *    - id: The identifier for the market. Required.
 *    - resources: An array with IDs for resources the market consumes. Required.
 *    - restockOnlyIncreases: If true, restocking never decreases quantity. Defaults to true.
 * 
 *
 * @param {Array} goodsDataArray: An array with one object for each goods type that
 * can be bought on the market. ID will be used as property name. Some special properties:
 *    - id: The unique id for the goods type. Will be used as property name under market.goods.
 *    - <resource>: Any property matching a resource ID will be interpreted
 *      as a cost. Several resources may be present for a combined cost.
 *    - any: Will be interpreted as a cost that can be paid with any resource
 *      type.
 *    - anyButSame: Will be interpreted as a cost that can be paid with any
 *      resource type, but all must be of the same type.
 *    - quantity: Set to an integer to limit the amount of that type of goods.
 *      Defaults to infinite.
 *    - maxQuantity: Set to an integer to cap the possible amount of the goods type.
 *    - resolver: Name of a method in modules[module].resolver. Called
 *      through market.resolve(goodsId, arguments...).
