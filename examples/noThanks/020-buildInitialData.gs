/**
 * This example simulates the No Thanks! game.
 * See also https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12942/no-thanks
 * 
 * Rules, briefly: There's a deck with cards 3â€“35, where nine cards are removed
 * before each game. A card is worth its value in _negative_ points. Each player has
 * 11 markers, worth one point each. The top card is displayed, and players take turns
 * to either place one marker on the card or take the card with all the markers on it.
 * The player who takes the card reveals the next, and then either takes it or places
 * a marker on it.
 * 
 * When there are no more cards, players get negative points for cards and positive points
 * for markers. But when cards form straights, only the lowest number in the straight
 * counts. Most points wins.
